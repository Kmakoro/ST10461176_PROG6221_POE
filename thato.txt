			-----------

1. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will regain access to your files, and it may encourage further attacks.
2. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker.
3. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, as they may contain ransomware.

ChatBot >> : 		Password
			---------

1. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is compromised, hackers can access all your other accounts.
2. Hackers often trick people into revealing their passwords through fake emails, websites, or messages. Always verify the sender's identity and avoid clicking on suspicious links.
3. Change your passwords periodically, especially for critical accounts. If you suspect a breach or notice unusual activity, update your password immediately.
