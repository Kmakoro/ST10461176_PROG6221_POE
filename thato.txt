ChatBot >> : 		Password
			---------

1. Change your passwords periodically, especially for critical accounts. If you suspect a breach or notice unusual activity, update your password immediately.
2. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is compromised, hackers can access all your other accounts.
3. Password managers securely store and generate strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. You only need to remember one master password to access them.
It’s okay to feel anxious, it doesn’t define who you are.
You’re stronger than you think, and you’ll get through this.
