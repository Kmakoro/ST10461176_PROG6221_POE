			---------

1. Adding an extra layer of security, such as a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app, makes it much harder for attackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.
2. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is compromised, hackers can access all your other accounts.
3. Change your passwords periodically, especially for critical accounts. If you suspect a breach or notice unusual activity, update your password immediately.

			-----------

1. Ransomware often spreads through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software.
2. Use reputable antivirus software that includes ransomware protection features.
3. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will regain access to your files, and it may encourage further attacks.
