1. Unexpected Attachments or Links: Be cautious of unsolicited emails with attachments or links, especially if they claim to be invoices, receipts, or important documents
2. Phishing is also a common way for hackers to install malware or ransomware on your device.
3. If you fall for a phishing scam, attackers can steal your personal information, access your bank accounts, or even commit identity theft.
