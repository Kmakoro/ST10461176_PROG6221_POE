1. Unexpected Attachments or Links: Be cautious of unsolicited emails with attachments or links, especially if they claim to be invoices, receipts, or important documents
2. Phishing is also a common way for hackers to install malware or ransomware on your device.
3. If you fall for a phishing scam, attackers can steal your personal information, access your bank accounts, or even commit identity theft.

ChatBot >> : 	Thank you I will make sure to remember that you are asking about passwords
ChatBot >> : 		Password
			---------

1. Change your passwords periodically, especially for critical accounts. If you suspect a breach or notice unusual activity, update your password immediately.
2. Reusing the same password across multiple accounts is risky. If one account is compromised, hackers can access all your other accounts.
3. Password managers securely store and generate strong, unique passwords for all your accounts. You only need to remember one master password to access them.
I so appreciate you saying that!

ChatBot >> : 		Ransomware
			-----------

1. To protect against ransomware, regularly back up your important files to an external drive or cloud storage, and keep your operating system and applications updated.
2. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker.
3. Use reputable antivirus software that includes ransomware protection features.
